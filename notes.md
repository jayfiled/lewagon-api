# APIs
> An interface used by programs to interact with an application

# Webhooks

> Your web app (server side code) contacts another server once to 'subscribe' to receive new data whenever it is available.  The other server 'pushes' you information whenever it becomes available.

As opposed to an API, where you call another server's API and it responds with data every time.
